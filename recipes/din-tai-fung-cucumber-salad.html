    <h1>Din Tai Fung Cucumber Salad</h1>
    <p>A refreshing and flavourful side dish!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Cucumbers</li>
        <li>Mushroom Powder (optional)</li>
        <li>Red Bell Pepper</li>
        <li>Sesame Oil</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Garlic Cloves</li>
        <li>Chilli Oil</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Warm Water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Time to cook!</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut your Persian cucumber into ¾-inch thick slices and add them to a medium bowl. Sprinkle the slices with salt and toss to combine</li>
        <li>While the cucumber is resting in the salt, slice your garlic cloves into thin slices.</li>
        <li>Pour warm water into a small bowl filled with the sugar and stir the water and sugar together until the sugar is completely dissolved. </li>
        <h2>HINT!:</h2>
        <p>If using the mushroom powder (which is optional), you can add it to the bowl and stir it with the sugar and water.</p>
        <li>Then, slice the bell pepper. Then, chop the bell pepper (skin side) into ¼-inch wide pieces.</li>
        <h2>PRO TIP!</h2>
        <p>Taste the salted cucumber after it’s been sitting for 25 minutes and adjust based on your preferences. If you find that it’s a bit too salty for you, you can rinse the salted cucumber slices and pat them dry before dressing.</p>
        <li>Plate the cucumber and top them with the sugar water mixture. Add the sliced garlic and red bell pepper.</li>
        <li>Dress the cucumber salad with sesame oil and chili oil.</li>
    </ol>
