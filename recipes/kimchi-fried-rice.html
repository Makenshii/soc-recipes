    <p>Easy and healthy Kimchi Fried Rice with smokey bacon and egg!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Cup Kimchi</li>
        <li>4 rasher of streaky bacon</li>
        <li>200g of Enoki mushrooms (root removed, risned and drained)</li>
        <li>3 cups of steamed wholegrain rice - if it's fresh leave it out for 5-10 mins at room temperature (day old rice works best)</li>
        <li>2 large eggs per portion</li>
        <li>1 tsp minced garlic</li>
        <li>1/4 cup Kimchi juice (from the bottom of the Kimichi container)</li>
        <li>1/2 Tbsp sesame oil x2</li>
        <li>1/2 Tbsp cooking oil</li>
        <li>1 to 2 Tbsp roasted sesame seeds, to garnish</li>
        <li>(optional) 1/2 stalk green onion, thinly sliced</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Time to cook!</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>On medium high heat preheat a pan/wok and once heated, add one of the sesame oil and spread it well with a spatula.</li>
        <li>Add garlic to the pan and stir for 10 seconds. Next, add bacon and stir until half-cooked.</li>
        <li>Add the kimchi to the pan, stirring until itâ€™s 80% cooked.</li>
        <li>Add the mushrooms and mix them well for a few seconds. Reduce the heat to medium-medium low.</li>
        <li>Add the rice and the kimchi juice. Mix all of them together well and thoroughly.</li>
        <li>In a different pan add the cooking oil and fry and egg how you like it - I like mine runny!</li>
        <li>Add the other sesame oil and mix them well. Remove the pan from the heat.</li>
        <li>Serve the kimchi fried rice on a plate. Garnish with the sesame seeds, and green onions (all optional). Place the cooked egg on top. Enjoy!</li>
